# üéûÔ∏èstreameasy
streamEasy is probably the simplest movie streaming site possible. 
Adless, simple UI, and static... no need to host a proxy on Node.js or whatnot.

streamEasy has 20 movies and 16 TV shows dynamically built in, with more accessible through our search which allows the input of a TMBD ID, which can be found [here.](https://streameasy.glitch.me/tmdb-id-finder.html) In addition, we offer sports streaming via Fastly that connects to Streamed.Su to avoid blockages.

StreamEasy has 20 sources to stream from, of which 6 are adless (for now...)
