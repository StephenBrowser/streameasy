streamEasy is probably the simplest movie streaming site possible. 
Adless, simple UI, and static... no need to host a proxy on Node.js or whatnot.

streamEasy has 8 movies and 7 TV shows built in, but more are accessible through our search which allows the input of a TMBD ID, which can be retrieved from the end of a TMBD description page for a movie.

Full documentation is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BmnW7TuDSONOdxSORO7QHKulBxeS5ndoHIf4PkXW5AM/edit?tab=t.0).
