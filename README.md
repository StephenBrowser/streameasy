# üéûÔ∏èstreameasy
streamEasy is probably the simplest movie streaming site possible. 
Adless, simple UI, and static... no need to host a proxy on Node.js or whatnot.

streamEasy has 12 movies and 9 TV shows built in, but more are accessible through our search which allows the input of a TMBD ID, which can be retrieved from the end of a TMBD description page for a movie. In addition, we offer sports streaming via Fastly that connects to Streamed.Su to avoid blockages.
